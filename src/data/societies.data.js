          Education (ISTE) which was established in Bharati Vidyapeeth College

          constantly strived to achieve its goal of focusing more on practical
          knowledge and hands-on approach.We have tried to achieve this through
          various sessions, workshops and competitions in the field of hardware,
          software and research. As of 2014, the society has more than 300
          registered members in the college.

          Students' Chapter NIT Hamirpur is the ISTE representative at NIT
          Hamirpur to promote such technical culture in our college. We, at NIT,
          throughout the academic year, organize a plethora of events to hone
          your technical as well as soft skills. At ISTE we believe in building
          people. Unlike the wild, where birds of a feather flock together,
          every student in a college is as different from other as chalk is from
          cheese. It is no mean task to forge a cohesive team comprising of
          assorted individuals with diverse and probably conflicting personality
          traits. At ISTE we strive to make it possible.
