          <b> Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE), </b>
          Students' Chapter NIT Hamirpur is the ISTE representative at NIT
          Hamirpur to promote such technical culture in our college. We, at NIT,
          throughout the academic year, organize a plethora of events to hone
          your technical as well as soft skills. At ISTE we believe in building
          people. Unlike the wild, where birds of a feather flock together,
          every student in a college is as different from other as chalk is from
          cheese. It is no mean task to forge a cohesive team comprising of
          assorted individuals with diverse and probably conflicting personality
          traits. At ISTE we strive to make it possible

          <b> Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE), </b>
          NITC is a techno-management club at NIT Calicut, and a student chapter
          of the Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE). We aim at
          practising the values upheld by ISTE, not just preaching them, by
          conducting various events for students at school and college levels.
          With the motto "Growth happens over time, not overnight", we aspire to
          inculcate within the students, a sense of curiosity and innovation.
